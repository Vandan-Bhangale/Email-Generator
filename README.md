# 🎙️ VoiceMail – Voice-Based Email Generator

**VoiceMail** is a simple and accessible voice-powered email generator that allows users to speak their email message and fill in the **To**, **Subject**, and **Message** fields using speech recognition. This is especially helpful for visually impaired users or for hands-free email drafting.
